    "description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note that the file hirise-map-proj-v3_2.zip below contains the latest images and labels associated with this data set.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This dataset contains a total of 64,947 landmark images that were detected and extracted from HiRISE browse images, spanning 232 separate source images.</p>\n\n<p>This set was formed from 10,815 original landmarks. Each original landmark was cropped to a square bounding box that included the full extent of the landmark plus a 30-pixel margin to the left, right, top, and bottom. Each landmark was then resized to 227x227 pixels. 9,022 of these images were then augmented to generate 6 additional landmarks using the following methods:</p>\n\n<p>1. 90 degrees clockwise rotation<br>\n2. 180 degrees clockwise rotation<br>\n3. 270 degrees clockwise rotation<br>\n4. Horizontal flip<br>\n5. Vertical flip<br>\n6. Random brightness adjustment</p>\n\n<p>The remaining 1,793 images were not augmented. Combining these with the 7*9,022 images, gives a total of 64,947 separate images.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n<strong>Contents:</strong><br>\n- map-proj-v3_2/: Directory containing individual cropped landmark images<br>\n- labels-map-proj-v3_2.txt: Class labels (ids) for each landmark image. File includes two columns separated by a space: filename, class_id</p>\n\n<p>- labels-map-proj-v3_2_train_val_test.txt: Includes train/test/val labels and upsampling used for trained model. File includes three columns separated by a space: filename, class_id, set<br>\n- landmarks_map-proj-v3_2_classmap.csv: Dictionary that maps class ids to semantic names</p>\n\n<p><strong>Class Discussion:</strong></p>\n\n<p>We give a discussion of the various landmarks that make up our classes.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bright dune and dark dune are two sand dune classes found on Mars. Dark dunes are completely defrosted, whereas bright dunes are not. Bright dunes are generally bright due to overlying frost and can exhibit black spots where parts of the dune are defrosting.</p>\n\n<p>The crater class consists of crater images in which the diameter of the crater is greater than or equal to 1/5 the width of the image and the circular rim is visible for at least half the crater&#39;s circumference.</p>\n\n<p>The slope streak class consists of images of dark flow-like features on slopes. These features are believed to be formed by a dry process in which overlying (bright) dust slides down a slope and reveals a darker sub-surface.</p>\n\n<p>Impact ejecta refers to material that is blasted out from the impact of a meteorite or the eruption of a volcano. We also include cases in which the impact cleared away overlying dust, exposing the underlying surface. In some cases, the associated crater may be too small to see. Impact ejecta can also include lava that spilled out from the impact (blobby (&quot;lobate&quot;) instead of blast-like), more like an eruption (triggered by the impact). Impact ejecta can be isolated, or they can form in clusters when the impactor breaks up into multiple fragments.</p>\n\n<p>Spiders and Swiss cheese are phenomena that occur in the south polar region of Mars. Spiders have a central pit with radial troughs, and they are believed to form as a result of sublimation of carbon dioxide ice. This process can produce mineral deposits on top, which look like dark or light dust that highlights cracks in the CO2 ice.&nbsp; Spiders can resemble impact ejecta due to their radial troughs, but impact ejecta tends to have straight radial jets that fade as they get farther from the center.&nbsp; The spider class also includes fan-like features that form when a geyser erupts through the CO2 layer and the material is blown by the wind away from the cracks. Fans are typically unidirectional (following the wind direction), whereas impact ejecta often extends in multiple directions. Swiss cheese is a terrain type that consists of pits that are formed when the sun heats the ice making it sublimate (change solid to gas).</p>\n\n<p>Other is a catch-all class that contains images that fit none of the defined classes of interest. This class makes up the majority of our data set.</p>",
